libwx-perl (0.82-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  TODO: lintian has weird executable-not-elf-or-script warnings
  
  * New upstream release.
  * Drop patch 01_fix_whatis_entries.patch, now included upstreams.
  * debian/copyright: shorten upstream download location.
  * debian/watch: extended regexp for matching upstream releases.
  * debian/rules:
    - remove obsolete source and diff targets
    - add install target to .PHONY
    - no need to rename {wx_overload,wx_xspp}.pl anymore, upstream has
      changed the names ("to comply with Debian policy", as the Changes file
      says) - thanks!
    - fix permissions of some files in /usr/lib/perl5/Wx/
  * Remove debian/{docs,examples} and install samples/* and README.txt
    directly from debian/rules
  * Add /me to Uploaders.
  * Add patch hashbang.patch: adds proper perl hashbang to scripts in
    examples/socket/
  * Rename patch 02_kill_bogus_test.patch to kill_bogus_test.patch.
